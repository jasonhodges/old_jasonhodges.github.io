I've been thinking a lot more lately about what is really important in life and I am starting to realize a few things. It is all good and well to have ambition and drive to achieve whatever measure of success you are trying to accomplish. I am constantly pushing myself to learn new skills and become familiar with new things all while keeping my eyes open and wheels turning with hope that I will not go stagnant in my pursuit to become successful. 

July of 2012 brought my wife and I the most amazing joy we had experienced when our son was born. He is the most amazing component in our life and our world revolves around him. If you are a parent you know what I'm talking about. In October of the same year I started attending WGU online for my Bachelors in Information Technology with an emphasis on Software Development. It's OK if you feel like university schooling, even online, is a joke. For me it is a personal goal to complete school and earn my degree. I have attended several different schools but never finished for various reasons but that will not be the case this time around. So if anyone is actually reading this I'm sure by now you are asking yourself. 


>"Where is this guy going with all this?"  


Since I started school I spend most every night with my computer; studying, researching, doing practice exams, etc. My wonderful wife provides an immense amount of support, allowing me to focus on school. Each night after our little man goes to bed I study. My wife gets a fraction of my attention and little quality time with me due to the time school requires. We have another kid on the way, due in September of this year, which adds to the happiness my little family already brings me. I know that I have a huge amount of responsibility to provide for my family, not only financially but as a role model, father and husband. I cherish every moment I have with my family and anything that infringes on that time, which has the possibility to be reduced, should be. 

I want my evenings with my wife back. When our son gets a little older and his bed time gets later I want to be able to give him my undivided attention. Later this year when our family expands with the addition of a baby I want to be there for my wife and provide all the help she needs. With this being said I have made it my mission to complete the rest of my schooling in the next year so I can take that time back. 

While having dinner with my wife recently I sat facing this sign on the wall inside the restaurant with the following passage: 


>"You can use most any measure when you're speaking of success. 
>You can measure it in fancy home, expensive car or dress. 
>But the measure of your real success is the one you cannot spend. 
>It's the way your kids describe you when they're talking to a friend." 


This little message struck a chord with me and has resided in my mind ever since. The important things in life aren't always what we obsess over. To me, working on school work, learning new web things, breaking and fixing my site, writing code...*are important*..until I start to put things into perspective. At the end of the day it doesn't matter what I've learned or what progress I've made on a website or even how much I might have BS'ed some uninteresting school work just to get it done. What truly matters is my family. Interest will come and go. New passions will flow in and out like the ocean tide. Family, however, will always be there. I am adjusting my way of thinking and realigning my goals to accomplish a different level of success. I am going to strive to make sure my children are proud to talk about their father. I **will** be the husband my wife deserves. My success will not be measured by my family providing a work description as an answer to the age old question: 


> "What does he do for a living?"


Instead my success will be stated as:


>"My father is incredible!"


and


>"I couldn't ask for a better husband..."
