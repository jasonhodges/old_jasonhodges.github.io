	<p>Let's see...What to write here, I've never been much for talking about myself. All my life I have liked the rewarding feeling of creation. When I was a kid I wanted to be an Architect and that transfered over to graphics and 3D and now I am interested in all things Web and Development. </p>
	<p>Outside work I enjoy spending time with my wife, two sons and our pets. I'm a huge music fanatic, but not for the stuff you hear on the radio.</p>
