It's crazy this world we live in. Some people have money, others struggle with making ends meet. Some people live a stable life and go year after year with no significant changes. For me this is not the case. Every year I have large life changing events that take place. 2013 has been no exception. 
<!-- /intro -->
I got hired on at a company I soon realized I really disliked. I brought up the idea of moving to Columbus and within no time I have a great job opportunity at SIHO as a web developer and we were buying a house in High Vista. We almost lost Remy when he became terribly ill and was in ICU at the VCA for a week. Now he is doing much better but somehow became more needy and annoying. We still love him though. Kelley is about to lose her mind with all the stress from the move along with watching after the dogs and Knox everyday. I hope 2014 is a little more stable and chill.
