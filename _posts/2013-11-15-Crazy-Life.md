It's crazy this world we live in. Some people have money, others struggle with making ends meet. Some people live a stable life and go year after year with no significant changes. For me this is not the case. Every year I have large life changing events that take place. 2013 has been no exception. 
<!-- /intro -->
I got hired on at a company I soon realized I really disliked. I brought up the idea of moving to Columbus, IN from Indianapolis to be closer to family and within no time I have a great job opportunity at [SIHO](http://www.siho.org) as a web developer. We got a house in the same neighborhood I spent my high school years in. We almost lost Remy, our French Bulldog, when he became terribly ill and was in ICU at the VCA for a week.  Kelley is about to lose her mind with all the stress from the move along with watching after the dogs and our son Knox everyday. I hope 2014 is a little more stable and chill.
