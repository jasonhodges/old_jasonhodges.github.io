I feel like I am always at a loss of time. No matter how early I get up or how late it is when I go to bed, there is never enough time in the day for me to complete everything I want to accomplish. Would it be different if I weren’t so focused on learning new things? Would it be easier to accept the lack of time if I only cared to get done what were required of me? 
<!-- /intro -->
Sometimes I wonder how other people live their lives. I wonder how some people are able to achieve a lot each and every day. I also wonder if people that just do the minimum get bored and wish they had something to do with their time or if they prefer not having anything to do outside daily routine. I barely have any time in the morning for anything other than getting ready, having a quick breakfast and running out the door. Spend all day at work and take a shorter lunch just so I can get back home sooner. When I get home I have a couple hours of family time and then what is left of the night I utilize by studying for school or self-education. I would love more time for family.. I would love more time to study.. I would love more time to design..

Sometimes I wish I could slow time down…
