	<h2>History and Who I Am</h2>
	<p>Let's see...I am not sure what to write here as I've never been much for talking about myself. All my life I have liked the rewarding feeling of 
	creation. When I was a kid I wanted to be an Architect and that transfered over to graphics and 3D and now I am interested in all things Web. Recently I 
	relocated myself and family for a job with a title of Web Developer (more Front-End*ish!).</p>
	<p>Outside work I enjoy spending time with my wife, son and our doggies. I'm a HUGE fan of music, don't think I could survive without it.</p>
